# School district analysis project
## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this report is to describe how excluding the data from 9th grade of the Thomas High School affected the results of the school district analysis.

## Results: 
- District Data. After excluding the data from 9th grade of the Thomas High School, we observed no change in the average reading and math score. However, the relative number of students with passing the math (74.8 vs 75) and reading scores (85.7 vs 85.8) were slightly lower along with overall passing percent (64.9 vs 65.2). 

-School Data. After excluding the data from 9th grade, we observed slightly lower average math (83.35 vs 83.41) and reading scores (83.39 vs 83.84) in the Thomas High School. Due to the small differences observed in raw data, the passing percent for math (93.2 vs 93.3), reading (97.1 vs 97.3) and overall passing percent (90.6 vs. 90.94) was slightly lower as well. 

-Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores  did not affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools.

Upon excluding the suspicious data from Thomas High School, the following were not affected
-Math and reading scores by grade 
-scores by school spending 
- scores by school size
-scores by school type 

##Summary
After having excluded the reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School, we observed slightly lower passing rates for math and reading in the level of the school and the district. These changes also translated to slightly lower overall passing rates. Considering that those chabges were small, the relative ranking of the Thomas High School in the district remained unchanged.
